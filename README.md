# HTC sous-dev

This tool is an electron app designed to improve the productivity of FileMaker devs at HTC.

The app assumes that you have node, a compiled version of [htcLib](https://github.com/NYHTC/applescript-fm-helper), and have the accessibility of the app enabled. Additionally, make sure you have `All Controls` selected under your `Full Keyboard Access` in your prefs.
